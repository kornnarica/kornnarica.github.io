## About Me
Hi! I'm **Your Name**, a Grade 11 exchange student in Canada from Thailand. I'm passionate about computer science and my dream is to get into Bachelor of Computer Science.

### What I'm Learning
- Data structures and algorithms
- Mobile development (Swift / iOS)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Machine learning fundamentals (Python, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Game Development (Love2D)

### Why I Love Computer Science
I love Computer Science because it lets me turn ideas into real tools — building apps, games, and systems that solve problems or help people. There's always something new to learn.
